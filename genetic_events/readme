# Usage

"cmm-recom.py" was used to label the co-mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and to determine the genetic events (i.e. mutation or recombination).

Open the cmd in windows and import:

python cmm-recom.py sequence.fasta reference.fasta co-mutations group_mut recombination.xls mutation.xls group.xls G0.xls

Input Arguments:

sequence.fasta: the SARS-CoV-2 genomes after alignment with reference sequence (EPI_ISL_402125).

reference.fasta: EPI_ISL_402125 is used as the reference sequence.

co-mutations: a list including the identified co-mutations.

group_mut: a list including groups and corresponding co-mutation modules.

Output files:

recombination.xls: sequences identified as recombinants.

mutation.xls: sequences identified as mutants of a group.

group.xls: sequences belonging to groups.

G0.xls: sequences belonging to G0.
